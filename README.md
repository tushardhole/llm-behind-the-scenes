# LLM Behind the Scenes

Welcome to the **LLM Behind the Scenes** series, the companion repository for the YouTube channel [The ML-AI Kid](https://youtube.com/@theml-aikid).  
This repo contains code demos and exercises that explore how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **transformers** work under the hood.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn
- Basics of **transformer models** and how they process text
- **Vector embeddings** and vector mathematics for semantic similarity
- Hands-on demos with **BERT** and **spaCy**
- Practical exercises in **NLP, transformers, and generative AI**

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `transformers_demo.py` → Intro demo using BERT embeddings + spaCy for entity detection
- Future scripts → Scoped exercises on topics like attention, tokenization, and generative AI

## 🛠️ Setup with Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
